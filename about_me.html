                    <p id="intro_text">I am the husband to my beautiful wife and best friend whom I have known since my senior year in high school.  We also went to college together where 
                        our relationship only grew stronger.  We stuck together through some hard times and got married in 2019.  Today, I live with my wife in an apartment 
                        in Queens, New York where we enjoy spending time with friends and family and experiencing the many things that New York has to offer.

                    <p id="intro_text">I am the son of two Latin American immigrants.  My mother is from Peru and my father is from Ecuador.  My parents met each in other in Quito, Ecuador
                        at a very young.  They moved to the United States at the age of 20 where I was born in Long Island, New York.  Over the years my parents had two other boys who are my
                        younger brothers.  Through dealing with the hardships of being immigrants whilst raising three boys, my parents have exemplified attributes such as hard work, persistence, 
                        and positivity that I try to live by in my life!

                    <p id="intro_text">Throughout my years in college I pursued the sport of powerlifting where I competed in many competitions.  I trained to lift the most weight I could possibly
                        handle in the barbell squat, bench press, and deadlift.  I retired from powerlifting in 2019, but to this day fitness is still a big part of my life and I center my workouts around
                        the lessons I learned during my powerlifting career.  Aside from fitness, my other hobbies include watching any move/show relating to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, playing RPG video
                        games, and trying out different foods :)
