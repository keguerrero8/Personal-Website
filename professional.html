                    I attended the City College of New York (CUNY) during my Freshmen year of college and transferred over to Stony Brook University
                    during my Sophomore year of college.  I minored in Nanotechnology studies since this was the area I wanted to focus my graduate studies on.
                    I also conducted research on the effects of chemically engineered nanoparticles on the performance of MRI-related technology.
                    I finished with a Bachelor's of Engineering Degree in Biomedical Engineering and graduated in the year of 2014.

                    I applied and got accepted to the Biomedical Engineering PhD program at Stony Brook University during 2014 where I conducted research on 
                    Microfluidics for biomedical applications.  During one of my semesters in graduate school, I got offered an internship position at Cook Medical
                    based in Bloomington, Indiana. During my experience at Cook, I quickly fell in love with the medical device industry and was determined to pursue a 
                    professional role outside of academia. After the end of my internship, I decided to finish school in which I graduated with a Master's Degree in Biomedical Engineering
                    in 2016. I began the job hunting process to search for an engineering role in the medical device industry.

                    I got offered a contract position at Siemens Healthineers to work in the Reliability Engineering department. I spent about a year there 
                    operating Immunoassay Analyzers used for Laboratory Diagnostics and simulating customer usage to increase occurrences of engineering issues. I was given a chance to
                    pursue a more technical role in engineering during my second year and assisted senior engineers in conducting characterization studies for design concept feasability.
                    During my third year I was given a major role in an upcoming project to design and develop software features that would perform calibrations within the instrument.  These
                    features had direct impact on assay performance and results.  I spent 3 years in this role and became an integral part of the Systems Engineering group where I designed, developed
                    and provided subject matter expertise on several software and mechanical features.

                    During the latter end of my years at Siemens Healthineers, I worked very closely with Software engineers to design software features and other related deliverables.
                    At one point, I took it upon myself to learn the C# programming language just enough so I could understand the source code of legacy features.  I fell in love with coding so much
                    that I would take ownership of features as a whole by writing the design specs as well as the code for implementation. I felt like this was my real passion, but I could not do it
                    full-time while dedicating most of my time to my job.  I made the big decision to take some time off from my engineering role at Siemens and decided I wanted to pursue a career in
                    Software engineering.  During the month leading up to my final days at Siemens, I began taking an intro course for Python through Codecademy.  To speed up my learning I decided to
                    pursue a Software Engineering bootcamp at Flatiron School.  I spend my days now learning Python and honing my skills through an online website called codewars.  I am also learning 
                    about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as I prepare for my bootcamp starting on November 22, 2021!
